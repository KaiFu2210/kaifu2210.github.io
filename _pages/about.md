<span class="font-weight-light">I am a third year PhD student at [Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/imb/), in the [Geometry group](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/imb/geometrie).</span>

<span class="font-weight-light">I am co-advised by [Vincent Delecroix](https://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/) and [Elise Goujard](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~egoujard/).</span>

<span class="font-weight-light">I am interested in various aspects of surfaces (real two-dimensional manifolds) and their associated moduli spaces, with a focus on the interactions between geometry, combinatorics, and topology.</span>

<span class="font-weight-light">My research includes the study of flat surfaces, such as <span class="bold-text">holomorphic</span> and <span class="bold-text">meromorphic differentials</span>, as well as <span class="bold-text">flat cone spheres</span>. From a combinatorial perspective, I utilize tools like <span class="bold-text">Delaunay triangulations</span> and <span class="bold-text">Strebel graphs</span> to study flat structures and their deformations within moduli spaces. Additionally, I am interested in <span class="bold-text">curve counting problems</span> related to saddle connections and cylinders.</span>
